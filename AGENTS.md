# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.
<!-- END:nextjs-agent-rules -->

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server on :3000 (npm only; `package-lock.json` is the lockfile)
- `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` — run both after every change; there is no test framework, do not invent test commands

## Architecture

All backend logic lives in `src/lib` — there are no API routes:

- `db.ts` — pg Pool (globalThis-cached for dev HMR)
- `session.ts` — HMAC-signed httpOnly cookie sessions (hand-rolled on purpose; do not swap in an auth library unasked)
- `auth.ts` — `getSessionUser` / `requireUser` / `requireAdmin` (redirect guards; pages call these — `src/proxy.ts` is a defense-in-depth redirect for `/archive/:path*` only, optimistic and not a substitute for these checks)
- `queries.ts` — all reads, mapping DB rows → domain types in `data.ts`
- `actions.ts` — all writes as Server Actions, every one Zod-validated and auth-checked internally
- `data.ts` — shared types + pure display derivations; safe for client components (queries/auth/storage are `server-only`)

## Database — shared and live

The Postgres DB and `Travel_archives` storage bucket are **shared with the separate
`travel-archives` Express project and contain real user data**.

- Migrations are additive-only (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, new tables/indexes); never rename or drop what travel-archives reads
- No migration tool — run one-off scripts: `node --env-file=.env.local script.js` using the project's own `node_modules/pg`
- `approval_requests.action_type` has a check constraint with prose values ("mark as public", …); always map through `APPROVAL_TYPE_TO_DB` in `queries.ts`
- Never create test users/rows without deleting them afterwards

### Storage privacy flip (pending)

The `Travel_archives` bucket is still **public**. `media.storage_key` now records each
upload's raw object key, and `queries.ts` already serves ~1hr signed URLs (via
`createSignedUrls`, batched per query) for any row that has one — signed URLs work
against public buckets too, so this shipped ahead of the flip with no behavior change.
Before the bucket can actually be made private: (1) `travel-archives` (the separate
Express app) must be updated to use signed URLs as well, since it reads the same
bucket, and (2) legacy rows with no `storage_key` need a one-off backfill (derive the
key from their stored `url`) or their images will 404 once public access is gone.
The `storage_key` migration itself is still pending because `DATABASE_URL` auth
currently fails (likely a rotated password) — run `scripts/add-storage-key.js` once fixed.

## Domain rules (enforced — keep them that way)

- Exactly one admin, ever (DB unique index `only_one_admin`)
- The admin is a member of every trip and cannot be removed from one
- Trip slugs are immutable after creation (public URLs)
- Nothing becomes public except through an approved pitch in `approval_requests`
- Any trip member may pitch any media to the public gallery; retract/delete-public requests are uploader-only; private deletes are uploader-only and instant
- The public site must never link to `/login` — members reach it by URL only

## Conventions

- Design tokens only (`--moss`, `--ember`, `--paper`, … from `globals.css` / `design-system/MASTER.md`); never raw Tailwind palette classes
- Media with no `url` falls back to `<PaintedScene>` placeholders; real photos use `next/image` (Supabase host allowed in `next.config.ts`)
- Trip dates: use local date parts, never `toISOString()` — pg returns midnight-local Dates and UTC rendering shifts them a day

## Environment

`.env.local` (gitignored): `DATABASE_URL` (**single-quote it — the password contains `$` and Next.js expands `$VARS` in double-quoted values**), `SESSION_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`.
